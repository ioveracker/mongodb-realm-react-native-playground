# mongodb-realm-react-native-playground
A playground used to test and experiment with new versions of the MongoDB Realm beta.

## Getting Started
Using node@12 or newer, install dependencies with yarn:

```
yarn
```

Next, install iOS dependencies:

```
cd ios && pod install
```

Or, if you have `rbenv` installed and configured, you can automate installation of the expected versions of ruby and cocoapods by running `yarn setup:ios`.
